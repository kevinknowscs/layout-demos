# Overview

This project helps the developer fiddle with HTML layouts using React.
Sometimes in the course of writing web projects, it is necessary to experiment
with various HTML and HTML layouts before adding the code to your production
project.

For example, let's say you want to write some Flexbox or CSS Grid HTML, you
haven't done that in a while, and you want a playground to experiment around
with ideas. This project provides a nice, lightweight place to do such work
without messing up your production project.

# Running the Project

Run:

```
npm run dev
```

# Usage

Edit and add files in the components folder as-needed. Use one of 10
pre-written "Playground" components to experiment with code and HTML.
